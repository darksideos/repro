-An executable file for a specific CPU arch is disassembled
-Disassembly process
	-Backend feeds executable file to execfmt parser
	-Execfmt parser generates the code and data sections for the program
	-Code and data sections are passed to the backend, along with CPU arch
	-Backend feeds code and data sections to the CPU arch parser
	-CPU arch parser

	-Support: flat binary, ELF, PE, Mach-O, Python, Java
	-Class name: ExecutableFormat
		-def parse(f: file) -> Executable
		 Parse the executable and return it as an object
	-Class name: Executable
